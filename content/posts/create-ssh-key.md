# Creating an SSH key using Windows:

## 1. Open a terminal window. 
To do this, press `Windows + R and type "cmd"`.

## 2. Generate an SSH key pair. 
To generate an SSH key pair, type:
 ```
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
 ```
 
 *Optional:* Enter a passphrase when prompted. By default your private key will be stored unencrypted on your local machine; This is not ideal. Keep in mind, if you do create a passphrase, you will be prompted for it during each use unless you utilize a tool to do so.

## 3. Save the SSH key pair. 
Copy and paste the contents of the file `id_rsa.pub` into a text editor and save it as a text file.
```
%UserProfile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
```
This will output your public key. Copy this key to be used.

## 4. Copy the public key to the remote server. 
To do this, use the command 
```
ssh-copy-id -i path/to/public_key user@hostname‚Äù
```
The command will prompt you for your password.

## 5. Test the connection. 
To test the connection, type `ssh user@hostname`. If everything is set up correctly, you should be logged in without being prompted for a password.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an SSH key pair and copied it to the remote server.

## 2. Terminal
Enter the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa` and press enter.
## 3. Save Location
You will be asked to enter a file in which to save the key. Press enter to accept the default.
## 4. Passphrase
You will be asked to enter a passphrase. This is an optional security measure that can be used to protect the key. You can leave this blank or enter a passphrase.
## 5. Generation
The key will be generated and stored in the file that you specified.
## 6. Viewing the key
To view the key, enter the command `cat <filename>`, where <filename> is the name of the file that you specified in step 3.
## 7. Copying the key
To copy the key to the clipboard, enter the command `pbcopy < <filename>`, where <filename> is the name of the file that you specified in step 3.
## 8. Success
You can now use the key to authenticate with remote servers.
